## Motivation

## Dataset

### Original Dataset

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tr1gg3rtrash/yoga-posture-dataset

The dataset contains 2,700 + images classified into 47 categories.

### Cleaned Dataset

Thanks to Lukasâ€™s work, some obvious outliers that were classified into the wrong category were removed.
Then we get a cleaner dataset with 2300+ images and 47 classes.

## Approach

Approach Introduction(todo)

### 1. CNN

### 2. Train ViT From Scrach

### 3. ViT Based Fine Tuning

Validation accuracy on original dataset(2700+ images, 47 classes)

```
***** eval metrics *****
  epoch                   =        4.0
  eval_accuracy           =     0.9275
  eval_loss               =     0.4354
  eval_runtime            = 0:00:27.82
  eval_samples_per_second =     14.881
  eval_steps_per_second   =      1.869
```
